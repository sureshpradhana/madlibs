    madlib =f"Today, my fabulous camp group went to a(an) {adjective1} \
amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool {noun1} \
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my \
kind counselor shouted loudly, \"Everybody off the {noun2}.\" \
We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and \
we scurried in . I was so excited! I couldn't figure out\
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller \
coaster I really liked so, I {adverb1} ran \
over to get in the long line that had about {number1} people in it. When I finally \
got on the roller coaster I was {verb1}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees \
were knocking together. This was the {adjective2} ride I had ever been on! In about two \
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. \
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, \
I was a little {verb2} but I \
was proud of myself. The rest of the day went {adverb2}. It was a(n) {adjective3} day at the fun park."
